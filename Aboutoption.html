He has over 25 years of professional pastry experience, along with a Master’s Degree in Pastry.<br>

<h2>2. Sneha-</h2>
Sneha inherited her love for farm-fresh ingredients as well as a passion for cooking and baking. Starting at an early age, she began baking in some of Mumbai's best patisseries and bakeshops. It didn’t take her long to realize she needed to push her knowledge of baking and pastry to the next level and hence she joined hands with Abhishek and Shubham to form CakeNation.

<h2>3. Shubham-</h2>
Shubham has traveled extensively in Europe and Asia to broaden his knowledge of the pastry arts, including studying at the prestigious Tsuji Culinary Institute in Japan. The result is a pastry making style that is refined and highly creative. He juxtaposes global flavors in unexpected combinations resulting in exciting, yet perfectly balanced creations. Incredibly passionate about all things pastry, Chef Shubham’s first love in the culinary world is to create cakes, from simple, artistic ones to elaborate wedding cakes. Shubham feels that cakes should not only look good, but their flavors and textures must speak for themselves. He is the one who came up with the idea of CakeNation.
